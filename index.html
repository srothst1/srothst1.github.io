  <h1>Cesium unlock potential for geospatial data. As a city planner, it is important that you undertand the dangers of natural
  disasters such as earthquakes. While infrequent, earthquakes pose a grave dangers
  to the vitality of your city. In this article, we explain the causes of earthquakes
  and we use Cesium to create compelling demos that help you understand which part
  of your city may be at risk from past natural disasters. While tools such as excell
  make earthqake data diifuclt to understand and incaccesable, Cesium brings 3d and spacial
  data to life - helping you to make the most informed decisions possible.</h1>

    <h2 class="red-text" style="color: #bf3636;"> Fault Lines and Earthquakes </h2>
    <p>Earthquakes often occur near fault lines... One major fault line is the
      San Andres fault. Thus cities such as San Francsico and Los Angeles that
      are near the fault lines often have severe earthqueks. Cities such as New York and
      Philadelphia are further from fault lines and thus do not expiereince as
      many earthquakes.
